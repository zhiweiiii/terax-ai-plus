// (commonly 138-192 columns) inside ~335 CSS px forces either a 3px font or
// horizontal panning, and both are unreadable. So the grid is never shown:
// a headless xterm parses the stream (it is the only thing that gets ANSI
// right — wrapping, \r redraws, absolute cursor moves, alt screen), and this
// module reads *logical lines* back out of its buffer. Those lines carry no
// column count of their own, so the page re-wraps them at whatever width the
// phone actually has, at a normal font size.
//
// Two cases, one output:
//
//   Normal buffer — a shell. Lines scroll past the cursor and are collected
//   as they settle.
//
//   Alternate screen — a full-screen program (claude, opencode, vim, htop).
//   Nothing scrolls past a cursor: one screen is repainted in place. The
//   content still moves upward though, so successive frames are compared to
//   work out how far the screen scrolled, and the lines that fell off the top
//   are collected the same way. That is deliberately generic — it knows
//   nothing about any particular program's layout, so it does not break when
//   one changes its box drawing.
