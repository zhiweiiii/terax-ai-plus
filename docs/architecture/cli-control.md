# CLI control plane

This guide elaborates on `TERAX.md`. If anything here conflicts with `TERAX.md`, `TERAX.md` wins.

## Current surface

Terax bundles a small Rust client internally named `terax-cli`. Native terminal panes expose it as the public `terax` command:

```text
terax <file> [--line <n>] [--no-focus] [--json]
terax open <file> [--line <n>] [--no-focus] [--json]
terax ping [--json]
terax capabilities [--json]
terax identify [--json]
```

The app must already be running. A command launched inside a Terax pane targets that pane's space, even if another space or tab has UI focus. An external client without pane context falls back to the active UI context.

## Components

- `src-tauri/crates/terax-control-protocol` contains dependency-light request, response, error, descriptor, and method types shared by the app and CLI.
- `src-tauri/crates/terax-cli` contains the standalone console client. It intentionally avoids Clap, Tokio, reqwest, and Tauri.
- `src-tauri/src/modules/control.rs` owns endpoint discovery, authentication, message limits, concurrency limits, timeouts, path canonicalization, and request routing.
- `src/modules/control/` maps a caller pane to its tab and space, then performs the small set of UI-only actions.
- `scripts/build-cli.mjs` builds the target-specific helper expected by Tauri's `externalBin` bundler.

Rust handles `ping`, `capabilities`, authentication, and file validation directly. Actions that must mutate React state are emitted to the main webview and completed through `control_respond`. This keeps OS validation in Rust without duplicating the tab model outside React.

## Transport and authentication

The app binds an ephemeral loopback TCP port and writes a discovery descriptor to the user cache directory under `terax/control.json`. The descriptor contains the protocol version, address, process id, app version, and a random 256-bit token.

Security properties:

- The listener binds only to `127.0.0.1`.
- The Unix control directory is mode `0700`; the descriptor is atomically replaced with mode `0600`. Windows uses the current user's inherited profile ACL.
- Every request carries the token and is rejected using a constant-time comparison when it does not match.
- Messages are newline-delimited JSON and capped at 64 KiB.
- Request ids are bounded and restricted to log-safe ASCII.
- Connections and pending UI requests are capped at 32, with bounded read, write, and UI response timeouts.
- The CLI verifies that a cache descriptor still names a live Terax process before sending its token.
- File paths are canonicalized and required to reference a regular file inside an authorized workspace before the editor is opened.
- The descriptor is removed only when it still belongs to the exiting process, so an older instance cannot delete a newer instance's endpoint.

The token is injected into Terax-spawned native shells together with `TERAX_PANE_ID`. Child coding agents inherit the caller context intentionally, which gives them the same local UI-control capability as the terminal that launched them. Tokens must never be logged or added to command output.

## Command discovery inside a PTY

At app startup Terax creates a user-private, per-process `bin/terax` copy of the packaged helper (the main binary is `terax-prod`, so `terax` is free for the helper). That directory is prepended to the PTY `PATH`.

Existing PowerShell integration also defines an interactive `terax` function that executes `$TERAX_CLI`. The real PATH entry is still required because non-interactive child shells do not reliably inherit shell functions.

Launcher directories for exited processes are removed at the next control-server startup. Live process ids are preserved regardless of directory age.

## Packaging and size

`tauri.conf.json` declares `binaries/terax-cli` as an external binary. Tauri selects the file with the current target-triple suffix and signs or packages it with the app. `scripts/build-cli.mjs` builds the helper for the host triple.

The release profile uses one codegen unit, fat LTO, size optimization, abort-on-panic, and stripping. Always measure the actual target artifacts after changing dependencies.

## Current limits

- WSL panes do not receive the control credentials or CLI launcher yet. Windows path translation and WSL networking must be implemented together.
- Terax does not yet install a global `terax` command for external terminals. The bundled helper and cache descriptor already support that future installer step.
- The CLI does not launch a stopped Terax app yet.
- Split, tab, agent, screen-read, and input commands are not part of protocol version 1 yet.

These limits are explicit so unsupported paths fail as unavailable instead of silently targeting the wrong pane or exposing a credential for a command that cannot connect.

## Extending the protocol

1. Add the method constant and typed parameters to `terax-control-protocol`.
2. Validate authentication, protocol version, bounds, and OS-facing inputs in Rust.
3. Handle the method in Rust when it does not require React state. Route only UI-bound work to the frontend.
4. Resolve the explicit caller pane before falling back to active UI state.
5. Return structured errors and keep `--json` output stable.
6. Add protocol, parser, routing, platform, and size checks.
