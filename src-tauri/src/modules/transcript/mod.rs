//! What a coding agent actually said, read from where it writes it down.
//!
//! The phone used to reconstruct an agent conversation by parsing the TUI's
//! screen. That works, but it is a parse of a picture: a side panel reads as
//! speech, a spinner reads as a sentence, and every layout change is a bug.
//! Every supported agent persists the conversation in a structured
//! form, so the conversation is read from there and the screen is left to do
//! the one thing only it knows: what the program is asking you to pick right
//! now (see `docs/architecture/mobile-conversation-view.md`).
//!
//! Three backends, one shape:
//!
//! - `claude` - `~/.claude/projects/<escaped cwd>/<session>.jsonl`, appended
//!   as the session runs. No dependency, trivially re-read.
//! - `opencode` - `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`, SQLite. Its TUI opens
//!   no port and `opencode export` costs a process per read, so the database
//!   is read directly, read-only.
//! - `codex` - `~/.codex/sessions/<year>/<month>/<day>/rollout-*.jsonl`.
